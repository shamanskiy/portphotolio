# portphotolio
This is a simple online photography portfolio I've built for my wife.
The front end is written with HTML5/CSS3 and a little pinch of JavaScript.
The back end is based on Flask.
The portfolio is currently hosted on the [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) platform and can be accessed
via [https://sophiesophie.herokuapp.com](https://sophiesophie.herokuapp.com/).
AWS S3 is used for photo storage.
